# Design Topics To Explore

Topics identified as genuinely distinct from the current design philosophy document. Each needs in-depth discussion before being integrated.

## Pending

1. **Meaningful scarcity and resource tension** - limited resources as a design tool. "Do I heal or attack?" (Hollow Knight soul), "Do I use this now or save it?" (Zelda bombs, Resident Evil ammo). The anxiety of commitment with incomplete information.

2. **Safe spaces and the feeling of home** - Hollow Knight's benches, Zelda's towns, Factorio's base perimeter. Without a home, danger is constant noise. Without danger, home is meaningless. The contrast gives both their power.

3. **Commitment and tradeoffs** - mutually exclusive choices where every option has real cost. Hollow Knight's charm notches, Dark Souls's estus allocation. No objectively correct loadout. The player defines their identity through what they give up.

4. **Mystery and information withholding** - map fog, unnamed areas, hidden tech trees. Showing everything removes curiosity. Showing nothing removes direction. The art is revealing just enough that the player forms questions they want to answer.

5. **Compulsion loops** - Factorio's "one more turn" problem. Micro-cycles of: identify small problem, solve it, notice the next problem, solve that. Each step satisfying, each solution revealing the next step. Related to pain-before-relief but at a much faster timescale.

6. **Teaching without teaching** - Mega Man's wordless first screen, Breath of the Wild's Great Plateau. The game world teaches the player how to play without the player ever feeling taught.
