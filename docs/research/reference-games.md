# Reference Games by Design Principle

Games that exemplify the principles in the design philosophy document.

## The Complete Package (Most Principles at Once)

- **Zelda: Breath of the Wild** - open-world player agency, physics-based emergent systems, discovery through exploration, pain-before-relief with the Great Plateau
- **Hollow Knight** - mastery rewarded, exploration rewarded, fairness contract respected, pacing masterclass, world reacts to progression
- **Dark Souls** - player agency through build variety, fairness through consistent rules, shortcuts as pain-before-relief, world interconnection

## Emergent Systems / Rules Not Scripts

- **Breath of the Wild** - fire spreads, metal conducts electricity, wind affects objects. Small rule set, massive interaction space
- **Divinity: Original Sin 2** - surfaces system (oil + fire = explosion, water + electricity = stun). Rules-based combat that rewards experimentation
- **Rain World** - ecosystem simulation where creatures follow their own survival rules independent of the player
- **Noita** - every pixel is simulated physically. Fire, water, acid, explosions all follow real rules
- **Baba Is You** - the rules of the game are themselves objects you manipulate

## Pain Before Relief

- **Factorio** - the defining example. Every upgrade solves a problem you've been wrestling with
- **Subnautica** - oxygen anxiety before vehicles, depth limits before upgrades, navigation pain before beacons
- **Terraria** - each progression tier resets your comfort and then rewards rebuilding it

## Avatar Control / Game Feel

- **Celeste** - the gold standard for 2D platformer feel. Every technique in the design philosophy is present
- **Super Meat Boy** - instant restart, pixel-perfect controls, momentum that serves the player
- **Doom Eternal** - aggressive combat flow where every system feeds into every other system
- **Ori and the Blind Forest / Will of the Wisps** - movement that feels like flying

## Discovery and Curiosity

- **Outer Wilds** - the entire game is knowledge as progression. No power upgrades. You win by understanding the world
- **The Witness** - teaches its entire language without a single word of text
- **Tunic** - gives you a fake instruction manual in a fake language that you gradually learn to read

## Fairness and Readable Difficulty

- **Hades** - every death feels fair, every run teaches something, difficulty scales with player choice
- **Slay the Spire** - perfect information, every loss is traceable to a decision you made
- **Into the Breach** - shows you exactly what enemies will do next turn. Pure decision-making

## World Reacts / Player Expression

- **Dishonored** - the world changes based on how violently you play. NPCs react. Ending changes.
- **Metal Gear Solid V** - enemies adapt to your tactics. Use headshots too often, they start wearing helmets.
- **Undertale** - the game remembers everything, even across save files

## Pacing

- **Super Metroid** - the definitive example of spatial pacing and environmental storytelling
- **Portal** - perfectly escalating complexity with comedic relief as breathing room
- **Shadow of the Colossus** - quiet traversal between intense boss fights. The emptiness is the pacing.
