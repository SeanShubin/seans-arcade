# Game Design Inspirations

Games that inspire the design of Sean's Arcade.

## Games

- **Metroid** (Nintendo, 1986) — Pioneered open-ended side-scrolling exploration with ability-gated progression. One half of the "metroidvania" genre origin.
- **The Legend of Zelda** (Nintendo, 1986) — Dropped the player into an open world with no instructions and let curiosity drive everything.
- **Master of Orion** (SimTex, 1993) — Defined the 4X space strategy genre with elegant race design, diplomacy, and galaxy conquest.
- **Master of Magic** (SimTex, 1994) — Blended Civilization-style empire building with tactical fantasy combat and deep spell research.
- **Stars!** (Jeff Johnson & Jeff McBride, 1995) — Deep 4X space strategy built around custom race design and asynchronous play-by-email multiplayer.
- **Castlevania: Symphony of the Night** (Konami, 1997) — Fused Castlevania's action with Metroid's exploration structure. The other half of "metroidvania."
- **Streets of Rogue** (Matt Dabrowski, 2019) — Roguelite with immersive sim DNA where every class interacts with systems differently, producing emergent solutions.
- **Factorio** (Wube Software, 2020) — Factory-building automation where every upgrade solves a problem you've been wrestling with. The defining example of pain-before-relief.
- **Grounded** (Obsidian, 2022) — Backyard survival at ant-scale with progression-gated exploration, base building, and co-op multiplayer.
- **Necesse** (Minkoff, 2022) — Top-down survival exploration with crafting, base building, NPC recruitment, and co-op multiplayer.
- **V Rising** (Stunlock Studios, 2024) — Vampire survival with boss-gated progression, base building, and multiplayer on shared servers.

## Patterns

Recurring themes across these inspirations that inform design priorities for Sean's Arcade.

**Emergent systems over scripted content.** The best moments come from interacting systems, not hand-authored sequences. Fire spreads, classes interact with the world differently, crafting tiers unlock new possibilities. Small rule sets that produce large interaction spaces.

**Exploration as the reward.** These games drop you into a world and let curiosity drive progress. New areas, new mechanics, and new understanding are the payoff — not cutscenes or XP bars.

**Progression that unlocks new ways to play.** Ability-gating (Metroid, Castlevania), crafting tiers (Necesse, Grounded), race design (Master of Orion, Stars!), class selection (Streets of Rogue) — progression expands *how* you play, not just *how strong* you are.

**Deep systems, modest presentation.** Mechanical depth over visual fidelity. The complexity lives in the rules and their interactions, not in the graphics.

**Multiplayer as a system multiplier.** Co-op and competitive multiplayer amplify emergent systems. When multiple humans interact with the same rule set, the possibility space expands beyond what any single player experiences.
