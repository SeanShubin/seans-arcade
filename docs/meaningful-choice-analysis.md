# Meaningful Choice: BG3 vs Cyberpunk 2077

Elaborates on [design-philosophy.md](design-philosophy.md) principle #9: Choices Must Be Felt.

Why Baldur's Gate 3's choices feel meaningful despite unpredictable outcomes, while Cyberpunk 2077's choices feel hollow despite offering many of them.

## Why BG3's Choices Feel Meaningful

**Consequences are immediate and visible.** Side with the Tieflings over the Goblins and the world reorganizes around that decision in front of you. NPCs live or die. Camp conversations change. Companions approve or disapprove and tell you so.

**Choices are irrevocable.** Once a character is dead, they're dead. Once a faction is hostile, they're hostile. The game autosaves through consequences.

**Companion reactions are the feedback mechanism.** You might not know if a choice was "correct" in plot terms, but Shadowheart approving and Lae'zel disapproving gives immediate, emotionally resonant feedback. You're managing relationships, not optimizing outcomes.

**Small choices compound.** A conversation choice in Act 1 changes who's available in Act 3. A decision to spare someone pays off - or backfires - 30 hours later. The game builds causal chains you can trace backward.

**Genuine dilemmas.** The best BG3 choices have no obviously correct answer. Every option sacrifices something real.

## Why Cyberpunk's Choices Don't

**The world doesn't change.** You make dialogue choices throughout the game and Night City is identical afterward. NPCs don't reference your decisions. Districts don't change. Factions don't shift.

**Most choices are cosmetic branches.** Many dialogue options lead to the same outcome through different conversation paths. You choose how to say something, not what happens. The player senses this and stops engaging.

**Consequences are deferred to the ending.** The game banks everything on the final choice: Panam, Hanako, or Rogue. But 60 hours of inconsequential choices have trained the player to not believe the game is listening. The final choice is genuinely different, but trust in the choice system has already eroded.

**Side characters react, the world doesn't.** Individual quest lines can have good or bad outcomes, but they don't ripple outward. Saving someone in a side quest doesn't change anything outside that quest.

## The Design Principle

**Meaningful choice = visible consequence + irrevocability + the world remembering.**

All three are required:

| Element | Present | Absent |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Visible consequence | Player sees the impact | Choice entered a void |
| Irrevocability | Decision has weight | Player knows they can reload |
| World remembers | Later content reflects the choice | Nothing changed |

BG3 has all three. Cyberpunk has the third element only at the very end, and by then it's too late.

## The Unpredictability Paradox

BG3 choices feel meaningful despite not being predictable. This seems like it should violate the fairness contract. The answer: the player can predict the tone if not the specifics. "Siding with the goblins will probably make good people suffer" is predictable in direction. The specific consequences surprise you, but they're consistent with what you chose.

This is different from randomness. A random consequence feels unfair. An unpredictable-but-consistent consequence feels like a living world.

## Trust Is Cumulative

The player extends trust early: "I'll make this choice carefully because I believe it matters." If the game rewards that trust (BG3), the player invests more in future choices. If the game betrays it (Cyberpunk), the player stops caring. Once trust is lost, even a genuinely meaningful choice doesn't land because the player has disengaged from the choice system.
